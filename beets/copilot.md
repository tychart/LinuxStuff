What kind of tags do mp3 files have vs flac files?

MP3 and FLAC files use different tagging systems to store metadata, which includes information like the artist, album, track number, and more.

### MP3 Tags
MP3 files primarily use **ID3 tags**. There are two main versions:
- **ID3v1**: This is an older version with limited fields and a fixed size.
- **ID3v2**: This version is more flexible and supports a wider range of metadata fields, including album art, lyrics, and more. ID3v2 tags can be further divided into subversions like ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4¹.

### FLAC Tags
FLAC files use **Vorbis comments** for tagging. These tags are more flexible and can store a wide variety of metadata. Unlike ID3 tags, Vorbis comments do not have a fixed structure, allowing for custom fields¹⁵.

### Key Differences
- **Flexibility**: Vorbis comments in FLAC files are more flexible and can include custom fields, whereas ID3 tags in MP3 files have a more rigid structure.
- **Compatibility**: ID3 tags are widely supported across various media players and devices, while Vorbis comments are primarily used in formats like FLAC and Ogg Vorbis¹⁵.

Do you have a preference for one format over the other?

So I have flac files that I riped from my cd collectrion, how do I follow these instructions for the albums which have various artists that contributed to that one album?

▶︎ I have an album with tracks by different artists, why is it broken up into lots of separate albums, each with their own artist?

Navidrome only organises music by tags, it will not automatically group a folder containing a bunch of songs with different artists into one album.

For a “Various Artists” compilation, the Part Of Compilation tag (TCMP=1 for id3, COMPILATION=1 for FLAC) must be set, for all tracks.

For a single-artist album with a different artist name for each track (for example “Alice feat. Bob” , “Alice feat. Carol”), the Album Artist tags must be the same (“Alice”) for all tracks.

Note if Scanner.GroupAlbumReleases is set to false (default, see available configuration options), an album might be split in different parts if the tracks have different date tags.


To organize your FLAC files correctly in Navidrome, you'll need to adjust the tags for your albums with various artists. Here’s how you can do it:

### For a “Various Artists” Compilation
1. **Set the Compilation Tag**: Ensure that the `COMPILATION` tag is set to `1` for all tracks in the album. This tells Navidrome that these tracks are part of a compilation.
   - You can use a tag editor like Mp3tag or Kid3 to edit the tags.
   - In Mp3tag, select all the tracks, right-click, choose "Extended Tags," and add a new field `COMPILATION` with the value `1`.

### For a Single-Artist Album with Different Featured Artists
1. **Set the Album Artist Tag**: Ensure that the `ALBUMARTIST` tag is the same for all tracks. This should be the main artist of the album.
   - For example, if the album is by "Alice" and features other artists, set the `ALBUMARTIST` tag to "Alice" for all tracks.
   - Again, you can use Mp3tag or Kid3 to edit these tags.

### Additional Tips
- **Check Date Tags**: If `Scanner.GroupAlbumReleases` is set to `false` (default), make sure the date tags are consistent across all tracks to avoid splitting the album.
- **Use a Tag Editor**: Tools like Mp3tag (Windows) or Kid3 (cross-platform) are very helpful for batch editing tags.

I was considering using beets


Beets is a great choice for managing and tagging your music library, including FLAC files. Here's how you can use Beets to organize your albums with various artists:

### Setting Up Beets
1. **Install Beets**: You can install Beets using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install beets
   ```

2. **Configure Beets**: Create or edit the `config.yaml` file to set your preferences. You can specify the music directory, plugins, and other settings. For example:
   ```yaml
   directory: /path/to/your/music
   plugins: fetchart lastgenre
   ```

### Tagging Various Artists Compilations
1. **Import Music**: Use the `beet import` command to import your music. Beets will automatically tag your files using MusicBrainz.
   ```bash
   beet import /path/to/your/music
   ```

2. **Set Compilation Tag**: Ensure the `COMPILATION` tag is set to `1` for all tracks in a compilation album. You can do this manually or use Beets' scripting capabilities to automate it.

### Tagging Single-Artist Albums with Featured Artists
1. **Set Album Artist Tag**: Make sure the `ALBUMARTIST` tag is consistent across all tracks in the album. For example, if the main artist is "Alice," set the `ALBUMARTIST` tag to "Alice" for all tracks.

### Example Commands
- **Importing Music**:
  ```bash
  beet import /path/to/album
  ```
- **Setting Compilation Tag**:
  ```bash
  beet modify -a compilation=1 album:"Album Name"
  ```
- **Setting Album Artist Tag**:
  ```bash
  beet modify -a albumartist="Alice" album:"Album Name"
  ```

### Additional Tips
- **Use Plugins**: Beets has many plugins that can enhance its functionality, such as `fetchart` for album art and `lastgenre` for genre tagging¹².
- **Check Documentation**: Beets' documentation is very comprehensive and can guide you through more advanced configurations and usage³.

I have never used beets before, would it be able to also corretly tag and fix my audiobook collection as well?


Yes, Beets can also help you manage and tag your audiobook collection effectively. There is even a specific plugin called **beets-audible** designed for this purpose⁴⁵.

### Setting Up Beets for Audiobooks
1. **Install Beets and Plugins**: First, install Beets and the beets-audible plugin.
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install beets

   ```

2. **Set Tags**: Ensure that the tags for author, narrator, and title are correctly set. The beets-audible plugin will help with this, but you can also manually adjust tags if needed.
   - **Author**: Use the `artist` tag.
   - **Narrator**: Use the `albumartist` tag.
   - **Title**: Use the `title` tag.
   - **Album**: Use the `album` tag.

### Example Commands
