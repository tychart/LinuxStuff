## Configuring Beets
### Verify Configuration File
Ensure that the Beets configuration file is correct before using it:

- Config file location on TrueNAS:
  ```
  /mnt/pool/StorageNAS/Media/Audio/Music/Beets/config/config.yaml
  ```
- Compare it with `config.yml` in this repository.
- You can also run the following command inside the container to check the active configuration:
  ```sh
  beet config
  ```
  This outputs the current config settings, helping you verify that the correct file is being used.

## Using Beets
Once inside the Beets container, use it as you normally would with the `beet` command:

- **Folder Mappings:**
  - `/music` â†’ `/mnt/pool/StorageNAS/Media/Audio/Music`
  - `/downloads` â†’ `/mnt/pool/StorageNAS/Media/Audio/Music/IngestFolder`

### Importing Music
